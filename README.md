# MRS_TMM
In this repository we show how multilayer optical calculations can be applied to the MIRI MRS to model the fringes. To this end the Transfer-Matrix Method (TMM) is used for the calculations.

List of notebooks:  
0 - Agreement between Windt IMD and Byrnes TMM  
1 - Effect of spectral resolution on refractive layer transmission  
2 - Effect of incidence angle on refractive layer transmission  
3 - Effect of presence of aluminium substrate  
4 - Effect of presence of a blocking layer  
5 - Converting the buried contact reflectance into refractive index  
6 - Differential degradation of spectral resolution
